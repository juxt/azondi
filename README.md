Uses the [Communicating Sequential Processes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes) also known as asyncronous programming to process real time sensor data in clojure for [opensensors.io](opensensors.io)

## Incubated with Jig

Writing 'quick and dirty' Clojure back-ends is fun, simple and easy. When Clojure systems get larger, separation of concerns becomes a harder problem. We know we should do it (that's progress at least) but it's easier [said](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) than done.

Therefore, this project is incubated with [Jig](https://github.com/juxt/jig). Jig pushes a separation of concerns into configurable components, while retaining the rapid development environment Clojure developers are used to. Jig is designed to be optional at deployment time.
